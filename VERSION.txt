TE_SPIDER_TIBLE_TOOL
--------------------

CHANGELOG:
----------
beta 12 : SARA 20210106
- created TE compare function prototypes for TE commands
- TE BUG: reply to CHARGEX cmd is same when ok or ko (in or not in FACTORYMODE)
- TE BUG: reply to BLEX cmd is very late 6s - so no check
- TE BUG: reply to SOURCEADC is same as to SOURCEFM
- TE BUG: reply to FACTORYDISABLE differs, supports both 0x04 or 0x0B statuses
- RESET cmd reorganized now contains: FACTORYENABLE, CHARGEX, FACTORYDISABLE. Even no sense but addresses major scenarios
- UART timeouts reconfigured (dependency on UART buffer size !!!)
- help revised

beta 11 : SARA 20201217
- BLEX TE command added (disables BLE audio) probably will not be used
- 4 commands allowed at once
- added TE ping verify command on known handle (speed up: not to scan all char desc)
- cleanup, refactoring

beta 10 : SARA 20201119
- TE introduces new characteristics 3b:21:a8:25:85:20:75:95:97:4b:09:64:eb:2a:83:c1
  however Primary GATT service remains the same
- handle for TE commands communication now taken from ATT_WriteReq response
- TE changes TE commands, removal of header byte 0x02
- BLE supervision timeout decreased from 20s to 1s because TE commands CHARGE, XCHARGE automatically disconnects
- char desc must be scanned all time (slow!)

beta 09 : SARA 20200630
- added TE commands SOURCEADC, SOURCEFM - source selection ADC (Line-In), FM

beta 08 : SARA 20200629
- GATT service discover by UUID (delivered from TE) rather than hardcoded handles, handle changes with TE SW version to version
- UUID: 00:00:00:aD:bb:da:ba:ab:e3:4d:00:6e:0a:e1:a6:10

beta 07 : SARA 20200617
- change default handle ATT_DEFHANDLE 0x001A, TE_GATT_HANDLE 0x0019, this is change by Teenage and hardcoded !!! ???

beta 06 : SARA 20200205 (release 20200603)
- HCI reset introduced as first command
- when connecting to non existing device Init Terminate (force) revised
- status verification of HCI Event packets (catch also TE cmd problems but should be 2nd level check)
- added PING command for response confirmation
- Teenage commands atomized, e.g. now needed to add FACTORYENABLE before commands
- code refactoring (te.h, uart.h added)

beta 05 : SARA 20200115
- delay commands raised 100 -> 250 ms , TE 200 -> 500 ms
- added TE charging mode commands CHARGE, CHARGEX

beta 04 : SARA 20200113
- delay TE commands raised 100 -> 200 ms
- bufhcitokenize implemented both EVENT and COMMAND packets
- makefile added

beta 03 : SARA 20191030
- output revised <Tx> + <Rx>
- MAC back conversion to string
- standardized, friendlier output
- added --help --version

beta 02 : SARA 20191021
- stdout debug out
- stderr errors
- check connection establishment

beta 01 : SARA 20191018
- first automatic version
- inputs COM_PORT BLE_MAC_ADRESS COMMANDS...
- only Tx commands
- no Rx handling

TODO:
-----
- HCI reset validation first command fails when something still in Rx buffer.
  Create function to get last HCI packet. (Current know solution, but not the root cause)
  Replicate:
  > TE_SPIDER_TIBLE_TOOL.EXE COM9 F4:80:6F:6F:E8:4A NONEXISTINGCOMMAND
  > TE_SPIDER_TIBLE_TOOL.EXE COM9 F4:80:6F:6F:E8:4A RESET
- check TE commands correctness, e.g. ends successfully when issued LEFT command without FACTORYENABLE
- Teenage hardcodes handle, better to dynamically, but how? Scan handle value?
- uni Rx handling
- interrupts instead of predicted response? Needed to production?
- dll for LabView

COMPILATION:
------------
mingw32-gcc -o TE_SPIDER_TIBLE_TOOL.EXE ble.c uart.c te.c main.c
